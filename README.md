# WGCNA-and-PPI-analysis
This repository contains the work from my undergraduate research project titled “Comparative analysis of protein–protein interaction network modules responsible for C3 and C4 leaf development: A Systems Biology Approach.”

The study applied a systems biology framework to transcriptomic data from maize foliar leaves (C4, Kranz anatomy) and husk leaves (C3, non-Kranz anatomy). Co-expression analysis was performed to identify gene modules associated with each leaf type. These modules were then integrated with protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks to uncover hub proteins that may play key roles in the development of Kranz anatomy, a defining feature of C4 photosynthesis.

The repository includes:

R scripts implementing the WGCNA workflow for transcriptomic data analysis and module detection.

Python scripts for identifier mapping, Louvain community detection, and hub protein identification within PPI networks.

This resource provides the complete computational pipeline developed for the project, offering a reproducible framework for exploring gene co-expression patterns and PPI network organization in comparative plant systems biology.
